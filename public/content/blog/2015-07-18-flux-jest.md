Flux and Jest
=============

I am finally unit testing my React components.  After looking through the various options, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) 
seemed seemed like the way to go.  My first unit test was

    jest.dontMock('../ProblemBrowserStore');

    describe('sum', function() {
      var ProblemBrowserStore = require('../ProblemBrowserStore');
      it('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', function() {
        expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
      });
    });

I deliberately avoided using ES6 syntax, and simply tried to import a Flux store into a trivial test.
I encountered problems immediately.  

    TypeError: ../stores/ProblemBrowserStore.js ... Cannot set property length of [object Object] which has only a getter

It turns out Jest doesn't work in the latest Node.  At this point, I retreated and tried to use Mocha.  That was painful, so
I came back to Jest.  I installed nvm to install node 0.10.

    $ brew install nvm
    $ ... configure nvm as per instructions dumped by brew ...
    $ nvm install 0.10
  
Now I get a different, less scary error

    TypeError: ../stores/ProblemBrowserStore.js: Cannot set property 'dispatchToken' of undefined
    
After some searching, I found a short, sweet 
[blog post](http://blog.benstokoe.co.uk/jest-flux-cannot-set-property-dispatchtoken-of-undefined/) that fixes this.

    $ npm test
    ... PASS  js/stores/__tests__/ProblemBrowserStore-test.js (1.607s) ...
    
And away we go!
